This adapter looks like a hockey puck, but `DOES NOT` support PD. (That's frustrating for laptops with 1 TYPE-C port). 
Also only supports one type of external display at once - so you cannot connect VGA & DP monitors. (confirmed with Dell laptop that supports 3 external monitors through wd10tb dock).
